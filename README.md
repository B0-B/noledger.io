A secure and anonymous messaging service based on a ledger protocol. Clients connect by exchanging addresses (Diffie-Hellman key exchange) and broadcast their ciphered messages publicly in a central ledger. Every client that synchronizes with the ledger is downloading each message but will be only able to decrypt it if he posesses the private key associated to the receiver's address. By the proposed protocol there are no sender nor receiver IPs to which encrpyted packages can be traced back. Users do not have to raise any concerns towards the service host, even if it is corrupt.

## Features
noledger.io is the only messaging service which

- ü§≤üèΩ is completely free, liberal and avoids any KYC
- üìú stores messages on a time-limited public ledger but respects integrity, authenticity and absolute anonimity through distributional entropy
- üïµüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è prohibits the tracing of connections, routes or meta data by design and with mathematical/informational certainty 
- üîê can always be trusted if the client-side protocol is obeyed, even if the service is corrupt

## Patch Notes
| Release | Patch Notes|
|---|---|
|v-1.2.0| - new console logger for traffic monitoring <br> - Added adaptive grouping mechanism server and client-side to protect clients from high traffic <br> - Improved server-side cleaner perormance through mapping entry IDs to group IDs <br> - Added new traffic module for group determination <br> - Added new "screen lock" mechanism which triggers on inactivity and when leaving the app <br> - Removed release script and other legacies |
|v-1.1.0| - Fixed generate AES key issue - Receivers were not decrypting correctly after AES key exchange <br> - Fully implemented account saving and loading for long-term usage <br> - Improved UI interactivity <br> - Added release script in release/ directory <br> - Added version badge to README.md |

## IP Spoofing
Protecting the user IP goes beyond the capabilities of the node-side protocol and is probably the only action which lies in the user's hands and spans across all web services. It is thus highly recommended to hide the IP via VPN or TOR window (Brave Browser for example). Attackers still cannot break the encryption nor reveal the E2E route of fetched packages but may map them in ciphered form to the origin IP. SOCKS5 implementation for a hidden service is already in plan.

<br>

## Setup
Run the setup script in the root directory
```bash
bash setup.sh
```
open the certificate path and generate a new certificate (optional)
```bash
cd ./cert/self_signed
bash create.sh # follow instructions in terminal
```
or store a valid certificate and key as `ssl.crt` and `ssl.key`.

<br>

## Start the noledger node
The default port will be 443
```bash
sudo node server
```

otherwise a port can be provided via argument
```bash
sudo node server 3000 # start the node on port 3000
```

For the default port open https://localhost in the browser. Access the web client by pressing the button on the landing page.
